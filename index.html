               <p class="paragraphs">I woke up early one Saturday morning anxious, trying to force myself back to sleep. Today was the day I actually had to pick my friend, James, up from Chicago, which I casually agreed to weeks before. But this was the actual day. The miles were real.</p>

               <p class="paragraphs">I got up reluctant to start my morning, ignoring my flip phone through all my activities hoping he doesn’t call. As soon as I go to turn on the TV, he calls. I let the phone ring as I contemplated answering. Finally I answer, “what’s up, bro”. He answers, what’s up bro, we still good?”. I pause seconds before responding, “yeah I got you bro”. He proceeded to give me the rundown as to when and where he would be as I mentally prepared.</p>

               <p class="paragraphs">After slamming close my flip phone after James hung up I instantly called my other friend Corey. I knew he would be down to go with me even if it took some convincing. After sweet talking Corey, I figured, it can’t be a party with just two people, so I hit our other friend Fred who was surprising but not surprising eager to come along for the trip. With the squad assembled we hopped in my ‘97 khaki Chevy Blazer and headed toward the Chi.</p>

               <p id="testP" class="paragraphs funParagraph">Good music taste is something all my friends and I got in common. So with music blasting, we cruised down 55 with me behind the wheel. With 45 minutes left til our destination we hear something rambling behind us. I put my head down cause I know that sound too well. We caught a flat! Unfortunately, because this same thing happened to another tire a week before, I had no spare tire. I pulled over to the side of the rode and called the insurance company for a tow truck.</p>

               <h2><a name="samaritian">A Good Samaritan</a></h2>
               <p class="paragraphs">We decided to hike to the nearest gas station where they supposedly had tires. Fred and Corey’s jokes and overall optimism kept me positive. Once we got there we found out that the auto part of their business was closed. A good Samaritan must have over heard us talking to the cashier and offered us a ride back to my truck. He also let us know the nearest tire shop that’s open. Surprisingly, the tow truck was able to find us off of my lousy directions. And I went on to spend $300 on a new tire to get us back on the rode.</p>

               <p class="paragraphs">Now, we’re back on the rode but this there was no blasting music. There was silence. Only sound was the tires hitting the pavement and the occasional call of directions. When we pulled up to the train station where James was, my resentment for him being the reason I was out of $300 dollars for a trip I didn’t even want to go on, quickly turned into excitement to see him and  laugh about the story.</p>
